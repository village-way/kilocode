# 🧑‍💻 Kilo CLI

> Kilo is the all-in-one agentic engineering platform. Build, ship, and iterate faster with the most popular open source coding agent.
> #1 on OpenRouter. 1M+ Kilo Coders. 20T+ tokens processed

## Installation

```bash
# Coming soon!
```

## Key Features

- **Code Generation:** Kilo can generate code using natural language.
- **Task Automation:** Kilo can automate repetitive coding tasks.
- **Automated Refactoring:** Kilo can refactor and improve existing code.
- **MCP Server Marketplace**: Kilo can easily find, and use MCP servers to extend the agent capabilities.
- **Multi Mode**: Plan with Architect, Code with Coder, and Debug with Debugger, and make your own custom modes.
- **Autonomous Mode**: Run Kilo in fully autonomous mode for CI/CD pipelines with `--auto` flag.

## Autonomous Mode

Use the `--auto` flag with `kilo run` to enable fully autonomous operation without user interaction. This is ideal for CI/CD pipelines and automated workflows:

```bash
kilo run --auto "run tests and fix any failures"
```

**Important:** The `--auto` flag disables all permission prompts and allows the agent to execute any action without confirmation. Only use this in trusted environments like CI/CD pipelines.
